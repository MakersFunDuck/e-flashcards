# e-flashcards
This is the code for e-flash cards, and it is suitable for any arduino board with an OLED screen.
It converts input.csv files to array for an arduino board, and it prints the meaning & phonetics of a word randomly from the csv file.

U8g2 library is used as a dependency, and it can be downloaded from Arduino library.


To update a code, simply, start e-flashcards.py, and it will create an arduino code, using the input.csv. Then open the upload.ino file with the Arduino IDE, and upload the code.
